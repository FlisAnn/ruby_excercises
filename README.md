Group Kata

# person1 = {name:"Ann", gender:"Female", age:40}
# person2 = { name:"Pip", gender:"Female", age:5}
# person3 = { name:"Mio", gender:"Male", age:5}

# group = [person1, person2, person3]

# group.each do |person|
  #  puts "#{person[:name]} is a #{person[:age]} year old #{person[:gender]}"
# end

row 12: Create the first hash and set name, gender and age
row 13: Create second hash
row 14: Create third hash
row 16: Put the hashes in an array. This is what I was having problems with, I started with creating the array my_group but never thought of that I should put the hashes in it. When experimenting and trying to get something to print I got person1 to print when removing the other code. But, this is where I went wrong and when I see it it makes much sense

row 18: the each iterator returns all the elements of an array or a hash. In this case we take group and go through the array i.e. person1, person2, person3. 
person = argument.
is this a declation of the argument? I had problem finding what I should use as an argument as well, I was trying different things such as key and value

row 19: puts= prints and then we call for the argument person and the value of the hashes

row 20: end ends the function


Movie Kata

I read teh instruction as that ther eshould me a number before each year which led me to for-loops
And once again I had a hard time figureing out that you can add an argument to the pipes without it being declared before. 

SyntaxError

I interperate this as the user has added a ')' instead of a '}'
